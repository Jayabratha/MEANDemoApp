# MEANDemoApp
This is a Demo MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) application where UX is the main focus. 

In this I am currently making a user management sytem where users can register, login and store content. Just a way of exploring Full Stack Javascript.
I want to create a more app like exprience with zero page refreshes and using animations in place of it to create delightfull user experience.
